# Life-Expectancy-and-Socio-Economic-Analysis

### Objective
To analyse socio-economic and health indicators in various countries over time, providing
insights into public health, environmental impact, education, economics, labour markets,
governance, sanitation, and disease burden, to inform policy decisions and improve well-being.

### Technical Details
Python language with libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn to compare, visualize and
predict the life expectancy of people of countries over the World.

### Innovation/Usefulness
This initiative innovatively combines life expectancy data with socio-economic indicators to
guide policy decisions. By examining correlations between life expectancy and various
dimensions, our project serves as a practical tool for informed decision-making in public health,
environmental sustainability, education, economics, labor markets, governance, sanitation, and
disease prevention. The concise yet comprehensive approach ensures actionable insights for
improving the overall quality of life!

### Introduction
Life expectancy at birth, a key metric in assessing population health, reflects the anticipated
lifespan of a newborn under prevailing mortality patterns. Our project delves into the dynamic
interplay between life expectancy and socio-economic factors across nations. This analysis
encapsulates public health, environmental impact, education, economics, labor markets,
governance, sanitation, and disease burden, aiming to offer comprehensive insights into societal
well-being.
We leverage a robust dataset sourced from Kaggle, ensuring the reliability and depth of our
analysis.The dataset is available at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life-expectancyand-
socio-economic-world-bank](url). The dataset includes a rich array of variables, providing a
thorough exploration of the intricate connections between life expectancy and various socioeconomic
indicators.
